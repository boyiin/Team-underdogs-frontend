# Team-underdogs - Frontend Repo

### CoinBase Exchange App

Welcome to master branch

This branch is for final deployment

There is a set of rules to follow while working:
Please remember this categories of commit: 
```
feature => use feat
chore => use ch
bug => use bg
```

**For a feature:**
  `git commit -m "feat: implement user sign up`

**For a bug:** 
  `git commit -m "bg: fix redirect"`

**For a chore:** 
  `git commit -m "ch: update docs to include api endpoints`

**Note:** For every feature, bug or chore, you must create a new branch.

Example of a feature?
User Sign up: Branch naming convention follow this pattern: feat/user-signup (- - - lower case and separated by dashes)

Example of a bug?
Sign up page routing typo: Branch naming convention follow this pattern: bg/signup-typo

Example of a chore?
Update Read Me: Branch naming convention follow this pattern: branch naming: ch/update-readme

Once you are assigned a task on trello, create a branch on your local git and only push to that branch. If you push to any other branch.

**To get started:**

Click on fork, scroll up. It is by the right top corner

Click on clone or download and copy the url link there

Head to your terminal.

**Step 6:** To start your work, work the directory that contains the project files.
cd Team-underdogs-frontend

**Step 7:** git remote add upstream https://github.com/DevCareer-Progate/Team-underdogs-frontend.git

Run: `git checkout -b <nameOfBranch>`

**Don’t forget the naming convention of branch.**

Note: <nameOfBranch> should be replaced with the feature you are working on (i.e feat/signup-component), use hypen when you will normally use space

For example,

`git checkout -b feat/sign-page-design` ✅

`git checkout -b feat/sign page design` ❌

Branch can either be: feature or bug or chore

Now, once done writing code and you have tested it and everything is working fine.

Run: git add .
Run: git commit -m "feat: design signup component"

`git commit -m "feat/design signup component"` ✅

`git commit -m "bug/fix login page header bug"` ✅

DON’T:

`git commit -m "feat/designed login page"` ❌

`git commit -m "bug/fixed login page header bug"` ❌

git push origin feat/signup-component-design - (Note how it ends with a branch).
